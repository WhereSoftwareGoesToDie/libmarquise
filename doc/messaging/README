This is the reference implementation for the messaging pattern we are currently
using.

Clients must connect to a broker with a REQ socket, which will listen with a
ROUTER socket.

Workers must connect to the broker on the PUSH and PULL sockets, to which the broker listens with a PULL and PUSH socket respectively.

For each item of work that a worker PULLs from the broker, it should PUSH a
response including all envelopes. A worker knows where the client's data begins
by looking for the empty delimiter.
